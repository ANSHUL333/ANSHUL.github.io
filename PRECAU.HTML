<p><b>How to help, lessen and even AIR pollution in your community:</b></p>
<p><b>The number one biggest thing that you can do is to drive less.</b></p>
<p>Vehicle emissions are one of the major sources of air pollution. Join with your local community to think of ways to get things done that don&#8217;t require a car, such as bikes and transit systems. If you must drive, if you can, switch to electric vehicles. See more specific ways below in other categories.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h1>PRECAUTIONS OU CAN TAKE!</h1>
<p>Check daily air pollution forecasts in your area. The color-coded forecasts can let you know when the air is unhealthy in your community. Sources include local radio and TV weather reports, newspapers</p>
<p>Avoid exercising outdoors when pollution levels are high. When the air is bad, walk indoors in a shopping mall or gym or use an exercise machine. Limit the amount of time your child spends playing outdoors if the air quality is unhealthy.</p>
<p>Use less energy in your home. Generating electricity and other sources of energy creates air pollution. By reducing energy use, you can help improve air quality, curb greenhouse gas emissions, encourage energy independence and save money! Check out the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's easy tips for conserving energy at home.</p>
<p>Walk, bike or carpool. Combine trips. Use buses, subways, light rail systems, commuter trains or other alternatives to driving your car..</p>
<p>Use hand-powered or electric lawn care equipment rather than gasoline-powered. Old two-stroke engines like lawnmowers and leaf or snow blowers often have no pollution control devices. They can pollute the air even more than cars, though engines sold since 2011 are cleaner.. </p>
<p>Don't allow anyone to smoke indoors and support measures to make all public places tobacco-free.</p> .</p>
<p>Avoid smoking indoors (but quitting smoking is the best answer for overall health).
    Use craft supplies in well-ventilated areas.
    Make sure your gas stove is well-ventilated.
    Minimize clutter.
    Remove carpeting if possible.
    Use a dehumidifier and/or air conditioner to reduce moisture.
    Keep trash covered to avoid attracting pests.
    Remove shoes at the door.
    Have car emissions tested regularly.
    Minimize air freshener use.
    Test your home for radon.
    Use carbon monoxide detectors.
    Fix water leaks.
    Dust surfaces and vacuum frequently.
    Wash bedding weekly in hot water.
    Make sure exhaust fans are functioning in your bathrooms and kitchen
    Keep a lid on scented candles..</p>
